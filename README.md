<h1>Jenkins Medium Assignmnent</h1>

<p>I have executed the python file which was given in a docker image named rakeshravi796/jenkin-python-dock. I have pushed it into the Docker hub.</p>
<p>After pushing it into the docker hub , I have created a jenkins pipeline for which SCM has been given as git and connected to this repository.</p>
<p>In jenkins file I have written three stages one is checkout , second is pulling the image from docker hub , third stage is running the docker image.</p>
<p>The image here is of the pipeline and my build has failed because of no docker in the jenkins container</p>
